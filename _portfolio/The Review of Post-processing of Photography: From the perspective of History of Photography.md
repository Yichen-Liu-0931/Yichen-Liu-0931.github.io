To clarify the Post-processing of Photography, it is necessary to understand Photography itself, understand the role of Photography in society and art, and analyze the motivation behind Post-processing. Therefore, to answer this question, one must first start with the History of Photography.

Firstly, the meaning of " Post-processing " has greatly expanded. Nowadays, digital Post-processing usually only refers to the process of creating images through image processing, which is a narrow definition of the Post-processing of Photography. In a broader sense, Post-processing includes a series of processes for photos making, such as developing, fixing, and enlarging in film, or new methods for compressing images in digital format.

Due to the progress of science, people are no longer convinced of the religious spiritual world. directly describing the real world can reflect people's thoughts more accurately. Therefore, since the Renaissance, the Art has generally pursued high-precision details, realistic styles, and strictly correct proportions in paintings, until the emergence of the predecessor of Camera, Camera Obscura. Through Camera Obscura, painters can draw large landscape images that are almost identical to actual shots. In addition, some painting methods that strictly use perspective relationships, such as the Physiootrace invented by Gilles Louis Chretien, indicate that this painting method is no longer related to artistic inspiration, but rather more related to science. That's why this very rigorous branch of painting laid the foundation for the birth of Photography.

The History of Photography generally regards the invention of Daguerreotype in 1839 as the origin of Photography. The invention of Daguerreotype was not intended to pursue artistic creation, but rather to record scenes as quickly as possible. The first few images of Daguerreotype, such as the Boulevard du Temple in 1838, were concrete and realistic works with almost no artistic meaning in themselves. Therefore, the original purpose of Photography was to replace the form of painting aimed at recording reality, and it did achieve this. Taking Landscape Photography as an example, many of the images of early landscape photographers provided a large number of samples for natural scientists, botanists, and geologists, which indirectly promoted the transformation of people's concept of nature.

The Post-processing of this period were mostly done solely for the purpose of photos making, without involving artistic expression. Each type has its own post-processing method, such as Woodbury Type, which involves gelatin rubbing, and gelatin silver salt in the later stage, which involves developing impressions. During this process, if the proportion of the prepared solution is slightly changed, the image will show with different brightness. In addition, the import of amplification process in double exposure allows to resize the final image, which can be said to be the first post processing method that has been passed down to the present day.

When did Photography become a form of artistic expression? In fact, until now, there are still some artists who do not believe that Photography has the expressive power of art. However, the birth of Photography cannot be separated from Art, and even the initial Photography can be understood as ‘technical Art’. Therefore, introducing some elements of Art into Photography is natural and reasonable. For example, as a record of reality, the Portrait Photography represented by Mother Alberts around 1840 has already demonstrated extremely rich details and quite accurate shadow, its composition and character expressions are still in line even today. This photo was taken in less than ten years since the invention of Daguerreotype, indicating that the source of this artistic foundation lies not in Photography, but in Art. During this period, some artists who had first tasted Photography, such as Hermann Krone, realized through extensive experimentation that Photography had great potential in artistic applications, despite its remarkable record. Taking Landscape Photography as an example, early Landscape Photographers summarized two functions of Photography in nature: accurately reflecting the composition and structure of scenery, expressing the fashion and attractiveness brought by scenery, which is clearly a function of artistic perspective.

In this way, we have answered the three elements that need to be born in the narrow sense of Post-processing of Photography: the initial purpose of Photography's origin, the initial purpose of Photography in the later stage, and confirmed that Photography has inherent artistic potential.
