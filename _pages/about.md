Welcome to Yichen Liu’s Homepage
======
The name Yichen, in Chinese, is very similar to the monastic title of Buddhism. Perhaps because of this, I am very curious about nature and society and fantasize about thinking and constructing a logical framework that explains everything (of course, sounds like the Grand Unified Theory). According to the Carl Jungian Analytical Theory [1], my personality falls into the INFJ-A of the MBTI, that is, Advocate (quiet and mystical, yet very inspiring and tireless idealists), and usually only 1% of people are similar to me. Although there are some uncertainty and shortcomings in Carl Jungian Analytical Theory, the personality of the Advocate is something I recognize.

I didn't choose Aerodynamics as my research interest at first. In fact, with professional painting practice for over nine years, I intended to become an automotive stylist and entered a few design competitions during my undergraduate period, but none of them won. I later realized that it was the Industrial Design program of my university that was too biased towards computer programming rather than styling training, I have lost the chance for professional styling education. To find a new direction, I began to frequently take part in various specialized courses at the School of Mechanical Engineering in my spare time and eventually became interested in Fluid Mechanics and Computational Mechanics. One of the reasons was that I was attracted by the smoke when it flowed over the car body. Therefore, I chose to become the recommended postgraduate at the College of Automotive Engineering, Jilin University, majoring in Vehicle Aerodynamics, which is one of the best places for the education of Automotive Engineering in China.

During the master's period, I found that I did not have an advantage over other graduate students in terms of specialized courses, because some mechanics courses were not offered during my undergraduate period. Therefore, I spent a lot of time dedicated to improving the mathematics related to Fluid Mechanics.

Luckily, two opportunities gave me new ideas. The first paper I cooperated with, was focused on the optimization of the mouth of the vacuum cleaner by using an interval optimization approach[2]. I was responsible for optimization discussions. In the process, I noticed the inaccuracy of the Latin Hypercube Sampling and Response Surface Method in the case of fewer samples. This was my first time to contact with Machine Learning based optimization algorithms for engineering. 

For the second one, I was responsible for a project in which I had to virtualize the wind tunnels and constructed the wind tunnel models directly in commercial software. The Virtual Wind Tunnel allows for full automation of the entire simulation process, as the effects of boundary conditions can be directly simulated and evaluated.

These two opportunities combined Machine Learning and Automation Workflow for industrial fields, which was what I learned during my undergraduate period. I realized that this knowledge is not supposed to be classical research fields in Fluid Mechanics, but is useful for horizon expansion. Thus, I introduced these two concepts into my final thesis by developing an automated wheel modeling platform[3] and a PSO-LSSVR Adaptive Approximation Model[4]. Although they still have points that can be optimized, the results show that these two concepts are well-suited for investigations and applications for Vehicle Aerodynamics.

Along with this, I wondered if the idea of Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning could be applied to data analysis in Fluid Mechanics, so I turned to Reduced Order Modeling. Through sufficient study, I introduced the Reduced Order Model into the analysis of the transient flow field of the rotating wheel and demonstrated the structure of the flow field inside the hub. In addition, I came into contact with the concept of Active Flow Control. It was natural to use a Reduced Order model to extract and learn the main features, and then perform closed-loop control of the flow field. I believe that as the cost of LES/DES gradually decreases, the Reduced Order Modeling will be one of the main tools for the next generation of transient flow field analysis in Vehicle Engineering, while the end-to-end adaptability of Machine Learning is a favourable methodology for complex environments.

This is the path of my experience in Fluid Mechanics. Although the results are still few, I am still in the process of deepening and summarizing. I have self-studied the theory of LBM, SPH and other fast computational methods, and developed a 2D solver-DRL coupling environment based on the Taichi Parallel Computing Framework, to evaluate whether real-time computation of flow fields has the potential to help efficient engineering applications. I am also in the process of pre-investigating the similarities and differences between Quantum Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks, and fitting universal Variational Quantum Circuits with unitary and binary functions, in preparation for further Quantum Computing environments. I will try my best to investigate and apply during my next period.

When the foundation is strong enough, eyesight and direction are even more important, and only by constantly beating the frontier with the further frontier can we never be defeated.
