In order to improve the performance of vacuum nozzle of dust, three structure parameters and an operating parameter were selected as the design variables, and 32 samples were obtained by using the orthogonal experimental design method. The discrete phase model was used to analyse the track of particles and the cubic re平ponse surface model was used to establish a prediction model, which is used to predict and evaluate the performance of vacuum nozzle. Based on the prediction model, an interval multi-ob」ective opti叩zation algorithm was adopted to search the optimal parameters. By adopting the opt叩ized structure, when the ground clearances are 8mm, 10mm, 12mm and 14mm respectively, the outlet mass flows of particles are increased by 6.33%, 3.54%, 2.02% and 2.33% respectively, and the total pressure losses are reduced by 18.09%, 16.14%, 13.22% and 14.29% respectively. It indicates that the interval multi­objective optimization algorithm is useful for structure optimization of the vacuum nozzle of dust.
