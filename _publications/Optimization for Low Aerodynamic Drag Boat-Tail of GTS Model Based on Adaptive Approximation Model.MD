To solve the problems of large sample size and low optimization efficiency of static approximation model, the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) based adaptive approximation model with particle swarm opti-mization (PSO) algorithm was introduced to construct the optimization algorithm. The global and local adaptive ap-proximation models were constructed to reduce the possibility of the optimization algorithm falling into the local opti-mal solution and to accelerate the convergence process. The Branin function was used as test function to prove the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive PSO-LSSVR approximation model for single-objective optimization problems. The adaptive PSO-LSSVR approximation model was applied to the rapid optimization of boat-tail of GTS model. The upper boat-tail angle, the lower boat-tail angle, the side boat-tail angle and the tail plate length were taken as de-sign variables, and the optimal solution could be obtained only with 31 sample data sets. And the error of aerody-namic drag coefficient predicted by the approximation model is only 0. 18% . The aerodynamic drag of GTS model with optimized boat-tail is reduced by 9. 38% after optimization, which proves that the adaptive PSO-LSSVR ap-proximation model optimization method is feasible for fast optimization problem with small samples.
